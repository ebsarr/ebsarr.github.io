      <description>I was looking for an article online that explains clearly how to idiomatically do logging in golang. What is the best practice? This is the article that I found by googling golang logging. It turned out not to be how-to article, but rather an opinion about what should developers log when writing their applications. Here are some thoughts about the article. I agree with some of the author&amp;rsquo;s opinions while I don&amp;rsquo;t with others.</description>

      <description>I had time during the new year holidays, so I went online to look for a web framework to develop web applications in golang. I accidently lended on the hugo site and discovered this awesome tool. The concept is very simple: you can easily generate a static website in a few minutes. This was quite different from what I was looking for, but it looked interesting and I decided to give it a try.</description>
