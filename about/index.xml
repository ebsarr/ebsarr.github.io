      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone! Thank you all for landing in my blog.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The idea of creating a blog has been on my mind for a very long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve resisted it for many reasons, but mainly because I&amp;rsquo;m naturally shy, don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about myself or my opinions, or even what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking, especially when nobody is asking. That is what bloging is about right? Talking about stuffs that people might not even care about. I however would like to get better at writing and expressing myself in general. That is why I decided to create this blog.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is an overview of the things I&amp;rsquo;m intersted in and might write about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT, mainly cloud computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding: I write code in python, golang and some shell scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll most of the time keep my political opinions to myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I might also write about some really unrelated subject, like sports, movies, music, whatever comes to my mind you know&amp;hellip;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this blog. Thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- EbSarr&lt;/p&gt;
