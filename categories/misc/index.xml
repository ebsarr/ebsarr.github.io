      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s looking? I guess only me huh? It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I have posted something here. It&amp;rsquo;s been hectic few years, and it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to sit down and write. But my everyday schedule is better now. I should be able to restart writing. My interests have changed since, so the blogs that will follow will be less about technical stuffs and more about things that I have experienced in my everyday routines.</description>

      <description>The past year has been a very agitated year in my career. Looking back at all the things that went or still going on, I want to take a stop and ask to myself, what am I doing? And most importantly, where am I going ? I made many mistakes, but the biggest one being that I have thought about everything but myself.
Looking back Two years ago I started managing a team to work on complicated projects involving cross collaboration with other companies.</description>
