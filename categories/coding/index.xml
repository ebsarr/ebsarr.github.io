      <description>What is petitdb petitdb is a python library that I created a few years ago. As you can guess by the name, it&amp;rsquo;s a library that provides some basic database functionnalities. Under the hood it&amp;rsquo;s just operating on shelves, inside which dicts of dicts are created. Each dict in the shelve is presented as a table, and inside each dict resides another dict that stores key/value pairs.
Use cases The main reason I wrote this was to store some configurations, mainly hostnames and some others attributes that go with it.</description>

      <description>I had time during the new year holidays, so I went online to look for a web framework to develop web applications in golang. I accidently lended on the hugo site and discovered this awesome tool. The concept is very simple: you can easily generate a static website in a few minutes. This was quite different from what I was looking for, but it looked interesting and I decided to give it a try.</description>
