      <description>I had time during the new year holidays, so I went online to look for a web framework to develop web applications in golang. I accidently lended on the hugo site and discovered this awesome tool. The concept is very simple: you can easily generate a static website in a few minutes. This was quite different from what I was looking for, but it looked interesting and I decided to give it a try.</description>

      <description>$ printf &amp;quot;%s\n&amp;quot; &#39;Hello, World!&#39; Hello, World!  I&amp;rsquo;m starting a fresh blog site and this is my first post. I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to post frequently and keep the site alive. A brief introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Japan for a very long time. I currently work in a Japanese company (been working there for more than a decade now). In the beginning, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to work as a technical support staff for one year.</description>
