Hello, World!
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting a fresh blog site and this is my first post. I&rsquo;ll try my best to post frequently and keep the site alive.
<br></p>

<h2 id="a-brief-introduction">A brief introduction</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in Japan for a very long time. I currently work in  a Japanese company (been working there for more than a decade now). In the beginning, I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work as a technical support staff for one year. This experience helped me a lot in developing my Japanese language skills, as I had to interact with Japanese Customers over the phone. After that, I&rsquo;ve spent many years doing operation and maintenance of the IT infrastructure, everything on-premise. I&rsquo;ve been working in the public cloud field for almost a year now.
<br><br>
I&rsquo;m interested in public cloud, IT infrastructures, coding and technology in general. I&rsquo;ve written a lot of shell/perl scripts for system administration during my ops days, and also some (web) applications in python. My main job has never been programming, but I like coding. I guess most of my posts will be about cloud, coding and stuffs like that&hellip;
<br><br>
I&rsquo;m neither a native English or Japanese speaker, but I&rsquo;m quite fluent and work daily in those two languages. My blog posts will be in English or Japanese, but I don&rsquo;t plan to have a version of both languages for every article. It&rsquo;s either one or the other. I hope to develop my writing skills in both languages while sharing some information of my interest. I hope some of it will be valuable to someone.
<br><br></p>

<h2 id="other-points-of-interest">Other points of interest:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reading: I read a lot of tech books, world history, thrillers and love stories. I also spend a lot of time on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></li>
<li>Sports: I used to play basketball in high school and closely watch the NBA season. I occasionnely go to watch BJ league games. I like soccer too.</li>
<li>TV: Yeah I love TV series and movies.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Thanks for coming by and I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy&hellip;</p>
